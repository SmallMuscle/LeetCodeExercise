        Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
        strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

        Note:
            The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
            You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
        Example 1:
            Input: 5
            Output: 2
            Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero
            bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
        Example 2:
            Input: 1
            Output: 0
            Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero
            bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
